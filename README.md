### This is a project written by Igor Nogueira, to help a famous casino to increase its revenue by the development of a online poker game to be further offered to the users. Here, you'll find a poker hands evaluator, that receives two poker hands and determines if the first hand wins or loses to the second hand.

### Let's introduce what's a poker game:

### Poker is a card game that can be played by 2 or more people, which consists (in the most popular mode) that each player has five cards in its hand, evaluates what's the configuration of your hand (there are 10 possible configurations, later it'll be described) and bets poker chips, which represents some money value.
